## Verified to work in Release
No modifications to this project were necessary.

## Compose sample application: ASP.NET with MS SQL server database

Project structure:
```
.
├── app
│   ├── aspnetapp
│   │   ├── appsettings.Development.json
|   |   └── ...
│   ├── ...
│   └── Dockerfile
└── docker-compose.yaml
```

[_docker-compose.yaml_](docker-compose.yaml)
```
services:
  web:
    build: app
    ports:
    - 80:80
  db:
    image: microsoft/mssql-server-linux
    ...
```
The compose file defines an application with two services `web` and `db`. The image for the web service is built with the Dockerfile inside the `app` directory (build parameter).

When deploying the application, docker-compose maps the container port 80 to port 80 of the host as specified in the file.
Make sure port 80 on the host is not being used by another container, otherwise the port should be changed.


## Deploy with docker-compose

```
$ docker-compose up -d

## Expected result

Listing containers must show two containers running and the port mapping as below:
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
7f3a2a7ea5c0        microsoft/mssql-server-linux   "/opt/mssql/bin/sqls…"   4 minutes ago       Up 4 minutes        1433/tcp             aspnet-mssql_db_1
27342dde8b64        aspnet-mssql_web               "dotnet aspnetapp.dll"   4 minutes ago       Up 4 minutes        0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   aspnet-mssql_web_1
```

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:80` in your web browser.
